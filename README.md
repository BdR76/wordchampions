# Word Champions

A fun word game!

## Building and hacking

First, do `yarn install` to install shadow-cljs. Then just `make`.

This will start a dev server on http://localhost:8000, serving the contents of `resources/public`.

To build in release mode: `make release`. After that, you can just server
`resources/public` with a static server.
